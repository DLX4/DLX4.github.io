《Designing Data Intensive Appliations》 被好多人推崇为神书。

感受下第一页的画风是这样的：

> Technology is a powerful force in our society. Data, software, and communication can be used for bad: to entrench unfair power structures, to undermine human rights, and to protect vested interests.

This book is dedicated to everyone working toward the good.
